# TestingAzureAutoTests
A playground to try out the automated testing features of Azure DevOps
-made this repo because running the Azure tests on my private repo for Kattis solutions was not passing tests, and it was seriously being a pain
-and I wanted to try out the testing on a functioning repo before I dive into what was causeing the errors in the previous attempt.

Created the repo, and ran the tests... "shockingly" the tests passed when only a README is present

Cloned from GitHub to my local machine

Created a new WpfApplication project, in a random directory

moved the project into the local directory for the repo, and then pushed the code to the remote repo
git add .
git commit -m "..."
git push

re-ran the Azure tests, and they still pass!
